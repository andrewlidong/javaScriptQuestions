# Is Square

Write a function isSquare(num) that takes in a number and returns true if the number is a perfect square, false otherwise.  A perfect square is a number that is the result of squaring another number.  For example, 3 * 3 is 9, so 9 is a perfect square.  

Examples:

```js
isSquare(7) => false
isSquare(15) => false
isSquare(18) => false
isSquare(25) => true
isSquare(36) => true
isSquare(9) => true
isSquare(16) => true
```
