# From Me To You

### High level idea

Split the sentence into an array consisting of word elements.  Initialize an empty result array.  Iterate through the split array and push you for any me, otherwise push into the result array.  Return the joined results array.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`

### Edge cases missed
