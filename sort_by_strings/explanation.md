# Sort by Strings

### High level idea

We will need several helper funcions.  

First, findOrder which will return the order in which returns a hashmap with keys corresponding to characters and values corresponding to their index position.  

Then, we need a comparator function which returns -1 if an element is smaller, 0 if an element is equal and 1 if an element is greater.  

Finally, we build a quick sort which takes in a string and a comparator and sorts our string s.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O()` <br>
- Space: `O()`

### Edge cases missed
