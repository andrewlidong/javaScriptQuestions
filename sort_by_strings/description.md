# Sort by Strings

Write a function sortByStrings(s,t) where the letters in a string s are sorted by the order they occur in the string t.  You can assume that t will not have repetitive characters.  

Examples:

```js
let s = "weather"
let t = "therapw"
let z = "odg"
sortByString(s,t) // => theraw
sortByString(s,z) // => odg
```
