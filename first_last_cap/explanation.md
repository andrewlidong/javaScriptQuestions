# First Last Capitalize

### High level idea

Build a helper function that takes a word (string) and upper cases the first and last word, and lowercases the everything else.  

Instantiate an empty array, split your sentence, iterate through it and push in the words with helper function invoked upon them.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`

### Edge cases missed
