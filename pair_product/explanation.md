# Pair Product

### High level idea

This problem will involve a nested while loop.  First loop through i = 0, then through j = i + 1, pushing into a productArr whenever i * j is equal to the target.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the array.  <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(N^2)` <br>
- Space: `O(1)`

### Edge cases missed
