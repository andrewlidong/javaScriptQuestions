# logEach, capitalizeWords, maxValue

### High level idea

All of these involve iterating through an array and conditionally performing some action.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`

### Edge cases missed
