# Element Count

### High level idea

Iterate through the array and push it into an empty object with count 1 if it doesn't appear, and increment by 1 otherwise.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`
