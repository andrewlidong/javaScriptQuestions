# Divisible by Three Pair Sum

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an array of all the pairs of indices whose elements sum to a multiple of three.  

Example:

```js
divisibleByThreePairSum([1, 6, 3, 4, 2, 0]); //=> [[0, 4], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4]]
divisibleByThreePairSum([8, 3, 5, 9, 2]); //=> [[1, 3]]
