# Least Common Multiple

### High level idea

Initialize a reassignable result variable.  Iterate through the product of num1 and num2, and if i is divisible by both return the index.  


### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(1)`
