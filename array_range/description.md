# Array Range

Write a function that takes in min, max and step as integer parameters and returns an array containing all numbers between the min and max at step intervals.  

Example 1:

```js
arrayRange(0, 12, 2) => [ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ]
arrayRange(2, 5, 1) => [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
arrayRange(100, 20, 3) => []
