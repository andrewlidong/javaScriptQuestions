# Abbreviate

### High level idea

Define vowels as an array of strings.  Iterate through the string, checking if each letter is included in vowels or not.  If it is, upper case it, otherwise, lower case it.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`

### Edge cases missed
