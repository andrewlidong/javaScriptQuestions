# Count Scores

Write a function that takes in an array of score objects (people) as its input.  A score object has two key-value pairs: a name (string) and a score (number).  Your function should return an object that has key-value pairs where each name is a key and the value is their total score.  

Example 1:

```js
var ppl = [ {name: "Anthony", score: 10},
            {name: "Fred", score : 10},
            {name: "Anthony", score: -8},
            {name: "Winnie", score: 12}];

var countPpl = countScores(ppl);
countPpl; //=> { Anthony: 2, Fred: 10, Winnie: 12 }
```

Example 2:

```js
var peeps = [
  {name: "Anthony", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2},
  {name: "Fred", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2},
  {name: "Fred", score: 2},
  {name: "Anthony", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2}
];
countScores(peeps); //=> { Anthony: 4, Fred: 4, Winnie: 6 }```
