# Mirrored Arrays

### High level idea

We're essentially appending the array with values from the back.  So let's just build a for loop that does precisely that.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the length of the array.  <br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(n)` <br>
- Space: `O(n)`

### Edge cases missed
